# pendulums-and-chain-models
This is a collection of various types of pendulums, cable modellings and ways of transporting a payload with cables. Next, I collect all the different alternatives and add the link for more details:

## [A 3D pendulum with a massed payload, including its mass and dynamics](https://github.com/Julestevez/pendulums-and-chain-models/tree/master/Payload%20and%20inertia%20effects#1--3d-driven-damped-pendulum-with-wind-mathematical-model)
Wind disturbance is also included along the Y axes.

## [Dynamic Simulation of Payload with Inelastic Cables](https://github.com/Julestevez/pendulums-and-chain-models/tree/master/Payload%20and%20inertia%20effects#2--dynamic-simulation-of-payload-with-inelastic-cables-mathematical-model)
In this simulation, a payload is held by two tense cables, where the payload mass, inertia and dynamics are included in the model. However, just one of the pivots is moving and the other one is fixed. As the cable is modeled as tense (a rigid bar), it can push and pull the payload, which is not realistic. This will be solved in next simulation.

## [Dual-Cable Payload Dynamics with Loose Cables](https://github.com/Julestevez/pendulums-and-chain-models/tree/master/Payload%20and%20inertia%20effects#3--dual-cable-payload-dynamics-with-loose-cables)
Again, the payload mass, inertia and dynamics are included in the code. Compared to the simulation before, the two pivots of the cables are moving, and the cables are loose, so that they can only pull the payload.
